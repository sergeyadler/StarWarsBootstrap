        <h1>Episode IV</h1>
        <h2>A NEW HOPE</h2>
        <p>
            It is a period of civil wars in the galaxy. <br>A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has
            challenged the
            tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE.<br>

            Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, rebel spaceships have won their first
            victory in
            a battle with the powerful Imperial Starfleet. The EMPIRE fears that another defeat could bring a thousand
            more
            solar
            systems into the rebellion, and Imperial control over the galaxy would be lost forever.

            To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new battle station. Powerful
            enough to
            destroy an entire planet, its completion spells certain doom for the champions of freedom.

        Luke Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic Civil War
        during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess Leia Organa and General Han Solo,
        Skywalker served as a revolutionary on the side of the Alliance to Restore the Republic—an organization
        committed to the downfall of the Galactic Empire and the restoration of democracy. Following the war, Skywalker
        became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic history.

        The son of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born along with his twin
        sister, Leia, in 19 BBY. As a result of Amidala's death and Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, the
        Skywalker children were separated and sent into hiding, with Leia adopted by the royal family of Alderaan while
        Luke was raised by his relatives on Tatooine. Longing for a life of adventure and purpose, Skywalker joined the
        Rebellion and began learning the ways of the Force under the guidance of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose first
        apprentice was Luke's own father.
